The Goose Site Repository
-----------------------------------------
This repository will be full of the code I used for my website!
Of course, some images may not be available but we'll see as we go along!
to view the html files, just open them in your browser and you can view them.
If you are intending to use the html files for some god forsaken reason, I won't care as long as you give some form of credit.
